# ![App Icon](icon.ico) Arduino  Led Strip Controller

This project is a Python-based application that allows users to control an LED strip connected to an Arduino. The application provides a graphical user interface (GUI) for selecting colors, adjusting brightness, and enabling various lighting modes such as Rainbow, Pulsating, and Ambient. The application communicates with the Arduino via a serial connection to send RGB values.

__Strictly personal program. For personal learning purpose only__

## Requirements
To run this application, you need the following Python packages:

- customtkinter
- Pillow
- pystray
- numpy
- sounddevice
- mss
- opencv-python
- pyserial

You can install these packages using pip:
```
pip install requirements.txt
```
## Features

- **Color Selection**: Users can select colors from a color wheel.

- **Brightness Control**: Adjust the brightness of the selected color using a slider.

- **Lighting Modes**:

    **Rainbow Mode**: Cycles through a spectrum of colors.

    **Pulsating Mode**: Changes the LED color based on audio input (bass, mids, highs).

    **Ambient Mode**: Matches the LED color to the average color of the screen.

- **On/Off Control**: Turn the LED strip on or off.

- **System Tray Integration**: Minimize the application to the system tray.

# Usage

## 1. Upload the Arduino Sketch
- Open the [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software).

- Navigate to the arduino folder in this project and open the .ino file (e.g., LED_Control.ino).

- Connect your Arduino to your computer.

- Select the correct board and port from the Tools menu in the Arduino IDE.

- Upload the sketch to your Arduino.

## 2. Connect the Arduino
- Ensure your Arduino is connected to your computer and the correct port is detected by the application.

## 3. Run the Application
- Execute the 'Led Controller.exe' from **dist folder** to start the application:

## 4. Select a Color
- Use the color wheel to select a color. The selected color will be sent to the Arduino, and the LED strip will update accordingly.

## 5. Adjust Brightness
- Use the slider to adjust the brightness of the selected color.

## 6. Enable Modes
Toggle the switches to enable different lighting modes:

- Rainbow Mode: Cycles through a spectrum of colors.

- Pulsating Mode: Changes the LED color based on audio input (bass, mids, highs).

- Ambient Mode: Matches the LED color to the average color of your screen.

## 7. Turn On/Off
- Use the On/Off button to control the power state of the LED strip.

## 8. System Tray
- The application can be minimized to the system tray. Right-click the tray icon to restore the application or quit.

### Notes
- Ensure the Arduino is properly set up to receive RGB values via serial communication.

- The Pulsating mode requires an audio input device to be connected and configured.

- The Ambient mode captures the screen's average color and may require additional permissions on some operating systems.
# Pulsating Mode
#### VB-Cable Virtual Audio Cable
**Purpose**: VB-Cable is a virtual audio device that allows you to route audio from one application to another. It is useful for capturing audio input for the Pulsating Mode.

Download Link: [VB-Cable Virtual Audio Cable](https://vb-audio.com/Cable/)

__Installation:__

- Download the VB-Cable installer from the [official website](https://vb-audio.com/Cable/).

- Run the installer and follow the on-screen instructions.

- After installation, VB-Cable will appear as an audio device in your system's sound settings.

__Configuration:__

- Set VB-Cable as the default playback device in your system's sound settings.

- Set VB-Cable as the default recording device to capture the audio input for the Pulsating Mode.
# Hardware Requirements
